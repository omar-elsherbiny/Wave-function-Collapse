# Wave-function-Collapse
I tried to implement this in pygame a while ago but looking back it had alot of bad code and some bugs, so i decided to redo the project again.<br>
The old code is in the v1 folder in a previous commit.

The `types.json` has all the rules for each tile type, each direction has its allowed types and their relative probabilities to be chosen
